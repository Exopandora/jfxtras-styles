### Documentation 
Documentation of JMetro can be found in this link: [JMetro Java, Javafx theme documentation](https://pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro).  

### Getting JMetro
You can download the jar from the [releases tab](https://github.com/JFXtras/jfxtras-styles/releases) or get it through
JCenter or Maven Central. 

### Source code
We have two important branches:

* **Master** -> JavaFX 8 / Java 8  
* **11** -> JavaFX 9 and above / Java 9 and above 

The 11 branch is being tested using JavaFX 11.

The jmetro-samples subproject has samples that you can run and check out how to use JMetro.

### Pull Requests (PR)
We welcome contributions via PR.  
Before submitting a PR please, please file an issue for prior discussion. This will avoid you wasting time with a PR that
might not be approved because for instance might be outside the intended scope of the project.

### Feedback request
Please send pictures of your application that is using JMetro, or a site that shows your application. This is very important for us
to know how users are effectively using it and make adjustments accordingly to make JMetro better.  And, only if you allow it, to showcase example uses.    
Seeing JMetro get used also always motivates me to keep working on it.
